\title{bin_probability}
\usage{
bin_probability(success, trials, prob)
}
\arguments{
\item{success}{number of success}

\item{trials}{number of trails}

\item{prob}{probability per success}
}
\value{
probability of success
}
\description{
Caculate the probability based on the number of success
}
\examples{

# probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
# probabilities of getting 2 or less successes in 5 trials
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
#55 heads in 100 tosses of a loaded coin with 45\% chance of heads
bin_probability(success = 55, trials = 100, prob = 0.45)
